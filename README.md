# quotation
A library and console application to display a quote in German, Spanish, or Latin to the user. Similar to the fortune program in Unix.

## Introduction
This project shows basic object oriented design in action.

## Rationale
I love studying languages, so I made a console app to show quotations in the languages I've studied.

# quotation
A library and console application to display a quote in German, Spanish, or Latin to the user. Similar to the fortune program in Unix.

## Introduction
This project shows basic object oriented design in action. It also uses unittest as the testing framework. The project includes the following files:

* Quotation.py is the main library file.
* show-quote.py is the command line application.
* quotation.cfg is the configuration file.
* german-history-file is a persistent dictionary used by the GermanQuote subclass.
* README.md contains this documentation.

The three .json files contain the data.

* german-quotes.json
* spanish-quotes.json
* latin-quotes.json

## Rationale
I love studying languages, so I made a console app to show quotations in the languages I've studied.
Although the project is a bit contrived, I feel it is a good (and brief) display of my coding style. And my documentation style.
